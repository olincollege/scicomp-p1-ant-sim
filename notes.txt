i decided to scrap my code and try to do this from the beginning for two reasons
1. it was very rough code and would have needed a lot of refactoring so i want to plan my code better to make it more elegant
2. i feel like my understanding of the model is very convoluted so i wanted to break it down into simple tasks and start from the beginning. 
part of what i'm doing here is also trying to plan my code in a way that it will be more elegant/need less refactoring.

Variables:
Ant
- needs to include its position
- needs to have an assigned index
Board
- 256x256

Questions that need to be answered on every run of the model:
- Where are all the ants?
- What are the possible next positions for all the ants?
- What is the pheromone count on each grid space?
- Is the ant following or exploring?

Things that need to happen on every run:
- pheromone evaportation
- pheromone deposition

Constants to take into account:
- fidelity --> how likely is a ant to follow a trail
- turning kernel --> how likely is an ant to turn in a certain direction when exploring
